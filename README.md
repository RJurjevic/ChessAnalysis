# **ChessAnalysis**  

ChessAnalysis is a **lightweight chess analysis tool** that annotates PGN files using **Stockfish 17** and **Vafra Cfish clones** (e.g., Cfish 12.7). It provides **clear, standardized chess glyphs** for evaluating game quality, detecting mistakes, and identifying key turning points.  

## **‚ö° Features:**  
- **Engine Support:** Works with **Stockfish 17** and **Vafra Cfish clones**.  
- **Standardized Chess Glyphs:** Clearly marks **inaccuracies, mistakes, blunders, and positional evaluations**.  
- **Customizable Margins:** Set thresholds for blunders, inaccuracies, and evaluation swings.  
- **Configurable Analysis Settings:** Adjust engine depth, and hash size.  
- **Fast and Lightweight:** No dependencies; simple command-line interface for efficiency.  

## **üîß Configuration:**  
ChessAnalysis uses a `config.txt` file for full customization of engine behavior and analysis parameters.  

### **Configuration Settings**  
Each line in `config.txt` corresponds to a specific setting:  

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr style="background-color: #ADD8E6;">
      <th><b>Setting</b></th>
      <th><b>Description</b></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Engine Selection</b></td>
      <td>Choose between <b>Stockfish 17</b> or <b>Vafra Cfish clones</b>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Engine Hash (MB)</b></td>
      <td>Set memory allocation for engine transposition table.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Engine Threads</b></td>
      <td>Number of CPU threads used for analysis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Syzygy Path</b></td>
      <td>Path to <b>Syzygy endgame tablebases</b> (optional).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Move Margins</b></td>
      <td>Define how inaccuracies, mistakes, and blunders are classified.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Good Move (`!`) Margin</b></td>
      <td>If a move <b>improves the position</b> by this many centipawns, it gets a `!`.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Excellent (`!!`) Margin</b></td>
      <td>If a move <b>greatly improves the position</b>, it gets a `!!`.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Score Evaluation Margins</b></td>
      <td>Define when a position is considered <b>equal, better, or winning</b>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Halfmove Range</b></td>
      <td>Analyze only moves within a certain range (useful for filtering long games).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Move Time (Seconds)</b></td>
      <td>Set time per move for evaluation.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```

### **üìù How Move Glyphs Are Assigned**
ChessAnalysis determines move quality by comparing **before and after evaluations**:
- If a move causes a **loss in evaluation**, it may be classified as:
  - **Dubious (`?!`)**
  - **Mistake (`?`)**
  - **Blunder (`??`)**
- If a move **improves evaluation**, it may be classified as:
  - **Good move (`!`)** if it **increases the evaluation** by at least the `Good Move (!) Margin`.
  - **Excellent move (`!!`)** if it **increases the evaluation** by at least the `Excellent (!!) Margin`.
- If a move is **expected and does not significantly change the position**, it remains unannotated.

To ensure accuracy, ChessAnalysis **re-evaluates** a position if the first pass suggests a good or excellent move. If evaluation keeps **improving**, it re-searches with **double the time**, repeating the process until a stable evaluation is found.

### **üèÜ Understanding Score Margins**
These thresholds define how the **engine classifies the position**:
- **Equal (`$10`)**: Score difference is **‚â§30 centipawns**.
- **Edge (`$14/$15`)**: Score difference is between **31 and 100 centipawns**.
- **Better (`$16/$17`)**: Score difference is between **101 and 200 centipawns**.
- **Winning (`$18/$19`)**: Score difference **exceeds 200 centipawns**.

This allows players to **track gradual positional shifts**, rather than only seeing sudden major changes.

---

### **üìå Summary**
- **Fully configurable engine and analysis settings.**  
- **Allows fine-tuning move classification and position evaluation.**  
- **Uses smart move re-evaluation to confirm good (`!`) and excellent (`!!`) moves.**  
- **Customizable time control, ensuring balance between speed and accuracy.**
