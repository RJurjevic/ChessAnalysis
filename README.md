# **ChessAnalysis**  

ChessAnalysis is a **lightweight chess analysis tool** that annotates PGN files using **Stockfish 17** and **Vafra Cfish clones** (e.g., Cfish 12.7). It provides **clear, standardized chess glyphs** for evaluating game quality, detecting mistakes, and identifying key turning points.  

## **‚ö° Features:**  
- **Engine Support:** Works with **Stockfish 17** and **Vafra Cfish clones**.  
- **Standardized Chess Glyphs:** Clearly marks **inaccuracies, mistakes, blunders, and positional evaluations**.  
- **Customizable Margins:** Set thresholds for blunders, inaccuracies, and evaluation swings.  
- **Configurable Analysis Settings:** Adjust engine depth, hash size, and move time.  
- **Fast and Lightweight:** No dependencies; simple command-line interface for efficiency.  

## **üîß Configuration:**  
ChessAnalysis uses a `config.txt` file for customization:  
- **Engine Selection:** Choose between Stockfish 17 and Cfish clones.  
- **Move Time per Position:** Define how long the engine analyzes each move.  
- **Evaluation Margins:** Set thresholds for classifying moves as dubious, bad, or blunders.  

Example `config.txt`:  
```
