# **ChessAnalysis**  

ChessAnalysis is a **lightweight chess analysis tool** that annotates PGN files using **Stockfish 17** and **Vafra Cfish clones** (e.g., Cfish 12.7). It provides **clear, standardized chess glyphs** for evaluating game quality, detecting mistakes, and identifying key turning points.

## **‚ö° Features:**  
- **Engine Support:** Works with **Stockfish 17** and **Vafra Cfish clones**.  
- **Standardized Chess Glyphs:** Clearly marks **inaccuracies, mistakes, blunders, and positional evaluations**.  
- **Configurable Margins:** Fine-tune thresholds for blunders, inaccuracies, and evaluation swings.  
- **Flexible Analysis Settings:** Adjust engine depth, hash size, and evaluation parameters.  
- **Comment Handling in Config:** Supports `#` comments in `config.txt` for better customization.  
- **Fast and Lightweight:** No dependencies; simple command-line interface for efficiency.

## **üîß Configuration:**  
ChessAnalysis uses a `config.txt` file for full customization of engine behavior and analysis parameters. Comments (`#`) can be added for clarity.  

### **Configuration Settings**  
Each line in `config.txt` corresponds to a specific setting:  

| **Setting**                 | **Description**  |
| ---      | ---       |
| **Engine Selection**        | Choose between **Stockfish 17** or **Vafra Cfish clones**.  |
| **Engine Hash (MB)**        | Set memory allocation for engine transposition table.  |
| **Engine Threads**          | Number of CPU threads used for analysis.  |
| **Syzygy Path**             | Path to **Syzygy endgame tablebases** (optional).  |
| **Move Margins**            | Define thresholds for inaccuracies (`?!`), mistakes (`?`), and blunders (`??`).  |
| **Good Move (`!`) Margin**  | If a move **improves the position** by this many centipawns, it gets a `!`.  |
| **Excellent (`!!`) Margin** | If a move **greatly improves the position**, it gets a `!!`.  |
| **Score Evaluation Margins**| Define when a position is considered **equal (`=`), edge (`+/=` or `=/+`), better  (`+=` or `=+`), or winning (`+-` or `-+`)**.  |
| **Halfmove Range**          | Analyze only moves within a certain range (useful for filtering long games).  |
| **Move Time (Seconds)**     | Set time per move for evaluation.  |

```

## **üìù How Move Glyphs Are Assigned**  
ChessAnalysis determines move quality by comparing **before and after evaluations**:  
- If a move causes a **loss in evaluation**, it may be classified as:
  - **Dubious (`?!`)**
  - **Mistake (`?`)**
  - **Blunder (`??`)**
- If a move **improves evaluation**, it may be classified as:
  - **Good move (`!`)** if it **increases the evaluation** by at least the `Good Move (!) Margin`.
  - **Excellent move (`!!`)** if it **increases the evaluation** by at least the `Excellent (!!) Margin`.
- If a move is **expected and does not significantly change the position**, it remains unannotated.

To ensure accuracy, ChessAnalysis **re-evaluates** a position if the first pass suggests a good or excellent move. If evaluation keeps **improving**, it re-searches with **double the time**, repeating the process until a stable evaluation is found.

## **üèÜ Understanding Score Margins**  
These thresholds define how the **engine classifies the position**:
- **Equal (`=`)**: Score difference is **‚â§30 centipawns**.
- **Edge (`+/= or =/+`)**: Score difference is between **31 and 100 centipawns**.
- **Better (`+= or =+`)**: Score difference is between **101 and 200 centipawns**.
- **Winning (`+- or -+`)**: Score difference **exceeds 200 centipawns**.

This allows players to **track gradual positional shifts**, rather than only seeing sudden major changes.

---

## **üìå Summary**  
- **Fully configurable engine and analysis settings.**  
- **Allows fine-tuning move classification and position evaluation.**  
- **Uses smart move re-evaluation to confirm good (`!`) and excellent (`!!`) moves.**  
- **Customizable time control, ensuring balance between speed and accuracy.**
